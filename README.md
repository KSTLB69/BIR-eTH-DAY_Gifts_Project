# Birthday_ETH_Gifts

Those (smart) contracts (2) will be use to send automaticaly some eth, to a specific date and address, after a certain amount of time.
I will use it as a "saving account" for some of my familly members (2).

Here are some features of those (2) contract :
- There is one contract for each person.
- Only the beneficiary can withdraw the funds.
- Everyone can deposit fund on the smart contract, at any time (Happy Birthday).
- The funds can be withdraw only after the releaseTime.
- The releaseTime correspond to the birthday date of the beneficiary : try to guess it if you want ;-)
